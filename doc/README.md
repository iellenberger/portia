# Portia Documentation

Portia documentation is broken up into a number of sections according to audience:

* **[End Users](EU-Home.md)** - the user that just wants to install packages.
* **[Package Builders](PB-Home.md)** - those wanting to create their own packages.
* **[SysAdmins](SA-Home.md)** - Operations folks who are building and/or maintaining their own Portia infrastructure (clients and repositories).
* **[Core Developers](CD-Home.md)** - Persons involved in the development of Portia itself.
* **[Reference](Ref-Home.md)** - For those wanting raw information.  No hand-holding here.

All documentation is interlinked as appropriate, so select your starting point from above and carry on.

### What's Up With the Mixed Documentation?

I hate markdown.  Unfortunately, it's the preferred format used by GitHub for their documentation, so here's what I'm gonna do.

* All instructions and things of the sort will be in markdown so that they are readable on GitHub.
* All reference material will be in manpages (via POD) as all proper reference material ought to be.

Once I feel that the documentation is getting to some level of publishability, I'll convert it to a more consistent format.
